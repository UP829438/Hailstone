# Hailstone
Submission for responsiv placement application on coding a hailstone sequence

## Website code folder:
This folder is meant as an alternative to the first part of the submission, which was to see some code and instructions on running the sample. 

To see this website in action, download the folder and open the index.html file in your browser.

## Hailstone folder:
This folder is the second part of the submission, the task was to write a recursive piece of code to generate forwards and backwards the hailstone sequence. The file was made in netbeans, and I have committed the entire project folder. To get to just the .java file, it is located in hailstone/src/hailstone.java.
