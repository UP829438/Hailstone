            On this website you are able to view my Literature Review about mitigating personal information exposure on the web, a discovery log which documents the various findings I have come across over my time studying WEBF1 at university and you can watch a
            video.
        </p>
        <h2 class="headings"> Literature Review</h2>
        <p>
            The literature review is a comprehensive study on how information about us is exposed and extracted from companies and how that information is then used. The review covers three main themes, How companies are supposed to keep our data, the inadequacies
            that those companies have when trying to protect it and finally what can be done about it.
        </p>
        <h2 class="headings"> Discovery Log </h2>
        <p>
            The discovery log has been created as a learning tool that allows the viewer to see what we have been up to over the past semester within WEBF1 practicals and lectures. The discovery log also has various elements of HTML code that helped make up this
            website.
        </p>
        <h2 class="headings">Video</h2>
        <p>
            The video I have chosen to add to my website is a short piece of coursework I had to produce. It is a music video for a song and was shot completely in stop motion. The video ended up having 1800 individual photos and ran for 3 minutes, meaning that each
            second 10 photos were used.
